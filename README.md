## Basic Overview
An attendance monitoring system for all our Chumbak Store employees across the country built on React-native.

## Installation Instructions

  - Go through the [installation.md](installation.md) file for critical project specific setup examples and guides.

## Features
- Create User/User Auth using firebase.

- AttendanceCam view to capture Images

- Upload View via Cloudinary

- User gets to see the last submitted attendance date and type.

- A separate  Dashboard to monitor uploaded attendance

## User Flow

 - **Initial App Fireup** ðŸš€
     - On firing up the app the user location tracking gets enabled and location coords are captured. The initial loading screen moves ahead only on success as location capture is critical to the app. This flow uses the navigator to track the [Geolocation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/geolocation).

     - The initial Login screen also has a loggedIn/loggedOut state check which checks for user login state each time the app boots up . You remain logged in until you hit logout ðŸ™„


 -  **Login Screen**  ðŸ”‘
    - The users can login using their credentials or create a new userID( based on their email). Authentication flows are based on the [Firebase Email and password web based authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/password-auth)  and  the [Firebase Create user Auth](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/password-auth) flows.

    - Forgot password  - The users are directed to a forgot password view where they enter their registered email. If the registered email is correct a reset password link is sent to the users' email-id. Firebase reset-password is used here.

- **Attendance Cam View** ðŸ“¸

    - This utilizes the [react-native-camera](https://github.com/lwansbrough/react-native-camera)
    to access the camera module. On capture the image is fetched from the source and this image is fed to [Cloudinary](http://cloudinary.com/).
    - The lat/long coordinates are destructured to get the location details using reverse-geocoding.
    - A firebase DB  fetch call checks if the user has previously registered attendance. If yes the last registered value along with date/time and type of attendance is fetched.


- **Upload Screen** ðŸ†™

    - Uploaded Image is fetched from Cloudinary and  the user data along with location, date/time of upload and Check-in/Check-out type is uploaded to Firebase DB.


- **Success View**

    - Upon successful upload ,the user is directed to this screen.
